# this folder will contain files of practice and work that we will do in the course about behave

          Suppose you create a feature file for a customer search

1. Add an scenario outline to simulate a search of a total priced for a list clients

You should send the name of the client
The ID of the client
The Total priced of purchase

On behind you should create a module with a dictionary containing the list of clients and the ID
and another dictionary with the ID of the client and the Total_priced, to perform the comparison between this values and the expected sent in the feature file.

2. Add a normal scenario to simulate the search of a client and verify that exists into the client list(using the first has created before).
